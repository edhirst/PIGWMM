# PIGWMM: Permutation-Invariant Gaussian Weight Matrix Models
Fitting &amp; analysis of Permutation-Invariant Gaussian Matrix Models to Neural Network weight matrices.

We recommend setting up a new environment for running of this package, the process for this is described in `environment/README.md`. 

Scripts may be run directly from command-line, after editing relevant hyperparameters within the scripts.
The script order follows: 
    1) `WeightMatrix_Generation.py` - to train NNs and save the weight matrices.
    2) `WeightMatrix_Analysis.py` - to compute PIGMM invariants and parameters.
    3) `WeightMatrix_Plotting.py` - to generate plots of this data as seen in the paper.
...supporting functions may be found in `PIM_Functions.py`.

# Permutation-Invariant Gaussian Weight Matrix Models  
Fitting &amp; analysis of Permutation-Invariant Gaussian Matrix Models to Neural Network weight matrices.  

We recommend setting up a new environment for running of this code, the process for this is described in `environment/README.md`.  

Scripts may be run directly from command-line, after editing relevant hyperparameters within the scripts.  
The script order follows:  
    1) `WeightMatrix_Generation.py` - to train NNs and save the weight matrices.  
    2) `WeightMatrix_Analysis.py` - to compute PIGMM invariants and parameters.  
    3) `WeightMatrix_Plotting.py` - to generate plots of this data as seen in the paper.  
...supporting functions may be found in `PIM_Functions.py`.   

In command-line the scripts are run via:
```
python3 WeightMatrix_Generation.py
```
...and equivalent.
